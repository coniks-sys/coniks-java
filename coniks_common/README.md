#CONIKS Common

http://coniks.org

##Introduction
These are the files common to the basic implementation of a CONIKS server and the simple CONIKS test client.

##Using the Common Files
### Protobufs
CONIKS uses Google Protobufs to define the message format for all communication between the test client and the basic server. Since the Protos Java files are generated by compiling the .proto files, you should never directly edit them! If you wish to modify the format of a specific message, do so in the appropriate .proto source file and recompile it (see [Using the Protobufs](https://github.com/coniks-sys/coniks-java/tree/master/protos#using-the-protobufs) for details).

### Building - With Maven
The coniks_common build is managed using Maven. (Instructions for building without Maven coming soon)

1) Install Apache Maven, if you don't have it. Visit the [Maven downloads page](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) for details.

2) Install the library into your Maven repository:
```$ mvn install```

3) If you don't use Maven to manage your own build, you can build a .jar file to use:
```$ mvn package```

These instructions will install the ``coniks_common`` Maven artifact.

## Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that this CONIKS reference implementation is under active development. The repository may contain experimental features that aren't fully tested. We recommend using a [tagged release](https://github.com/coniks-sys/coniks-java/releases).
